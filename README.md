# OR'S PROJECT

## Key notes:
- The focus was mainly on getting the functionality right, so while the user experience could be improved, I didn’t dive too deep into that.
- Since this is a smaller project, I went with a service to store the history rates and fetch data from the API.
In a bigger project, I would’ve used a store with effects to get the data and selectors to manage the state more efficiently.
- The results history is saved in local storage so that it stays after a refresh.
- I haven’t done the chart yet because I wasn’t sure where to place it or which currency to use. 
However, if it’s critical, I’d be able to work on it once I have some clarification on a few points.
